# ClothesStore

This project is a __web-based__ clothing store application that allows users to create an account, 
browse and add products to the store, place orders, and add items to their shopping basket as long as there is sufficient quantity in stock. 
Users can view the total price of their order and have the option to modify it.

The main goal of this project was to create a simple app that combines the __backend__ and __frontend__ into one project. 
For the backend, we used a __MySQL database__ to store the data, the __Flask framework__ in Python to create a localhost server and route pages, 
and __Jinja2__ to pass variables from the Python code to the HTML and to create __blocks of HTML code__ that can be used anywhere.

As for the frontend, __HTML__ is used to structure and organize the content of the web page, 
__CSS__ is used to style and enhance the visual appearance of the page, 
and __JavaScript__ is used to add interactivity and functionality to the page. 

__Flask__ is a micro web framework written in Python that provides useful tools and features for building web applications. 
It includes a __lightweight server__ and the ability to connect to a database, among other things. 

Jinja2 is a templating engine for Python that allows developers to generate HTML or other markup code from templates and data. 
It allows you to insert dynamic content into a template and keep the presentation separate from the application logic.
